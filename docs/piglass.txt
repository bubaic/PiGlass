class EventManager:
	NRC An EventManager is the controller governing inputs to PiGlass.

class ThreadManager:
	NRC
	A ThreadManager controls level-0 and level-1 subthreads.
    	PiGlass Apps are level-1 threads controlling PGApp Objects.
    	Background Monitors are level-0 threads started by ThreadManager.

class PGApp:
	NRC
	A PGApp is the main part of constructing a PiGlass app. 
    	It has three states: running, paused, and not running. Each of these has its own trigger.
    	A PGApp is initialized by the system by parameters from the apps manifest.
    	The system then calls the defined init funtion.
	
class ResourcePack:
	A ResourePack is a preloaded object with all the resources for an app.
    	It loads images as pygame.image objects and text files as lists of strings.
	__init__(list toload):
		Load and add items from <toload>
	get(str item):
		Get the item stored as <item>
	add(str item):
		Add the item specified in <item>

class ValueFile:
	A ValueFile is a file of x=y attributes with #comments.
	__init__(str path):
		Load and scan from <path>
	scan():
		Scan and load values from <self.path>
	get(str value, bool rescan=False):
		Get the stored data from <value>, rescanning if <rescan>

class LinuxScript:
	A LinuxScript is a representation of a shell script.
	__init__(str path, bool su=False, cdTo=None, async=False):
		Loads but does NOT run the script.
	run():
		Runs <path> from directory <cdTo> <async>hronously with <su> privileges.

class SyncedFile:
	A SyncedFile is a dict synchronized with a file.
    	The produced file is a valid ValueFile object.
	__init__(str path, str mode='w', dict initial={}):
		Initializes valuse but creates no files.
	store(str name, str value):
		Stores <name>:<value> into the internal dict.
	sync():
		Synchronizes the internal dict with <path> with mode <mode>

class SpeechRecognizer:
	A SpeechRecognizer provides the interfaces for parsing speech
	NRC

class Notification:
	A Notification is an object controlling a notification on PiGlass.
	__init__(str title, str text, pygame.image icon=None):
		Initializes the notification with <title> and <text>
	show():
		Shows the notification.
